# Project details
THis is the refactored version of the given code for Homework Week 1.  To refactor, got rid of span tags, and I added the semantic tags in place of the existing div tags.  I added alt descriptions to elements as well as titles to help with accesibility.  

To clean up the CSS file, I consolodated that elements that have the same attributes in 2 different ways.  For the aside, since all off the elements will always be in the same form, I used the parent class and the tag.  For the Main, I used each  section id and tag so it will be easier to reformat a single section of the main in the future.
